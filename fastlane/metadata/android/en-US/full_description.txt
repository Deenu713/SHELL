<i>$HELL</i> helps you getting used to shell scripting. It brings you a terminal emulator with a script editor built-in, so you can get control over Android CLI Interface. Some minor culprits:

* Terminal UI is not fully interactive
* Input command (read) does not work
* Infinite loop script crashes the app (so better do not create/run such)
